Hello I am Markus and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Media Informatics student currently enrolled at Harz University. My main focus of study is on game development, and I am actively learning and expanding my knowledge of C# to further my skills in this area.

Most of my repositories are related to projects that I have worked on during my time at university. Unfortunately, many of these projects are not available for public viewing due to privacy concerns. However, I am happy to share any code that I am able to make public and welcome any feedback or contributions.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any suggestions or collaborations in mind.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile!
